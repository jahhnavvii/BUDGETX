I'm having trouble reaching the AI service (Error: 404 models/gemini-2.0-flash-exp is not found for API version v1beta, or is not supported for generateContent. Call ListModels to see the list of available models and their supported methods.). Please verify your Gemini API key in the .env file or your system environment variables.
